“Sonar-Based Rock vs Mine Prediction in Underwater Environments”
This project focuses on designing a machine learning (ML) based system that can accuratelyclassifysonar signals into two categories: rock or mine. The project involves data collection, modeldevelopment, and performance testing, specifically tailored for underwater environments. Theproject could revolutionize industries such as defense, oil and gas exploration, and environmentalresearch. The system will utilize advanced deep learning models, ensuring the solutionis scalable,adaptable, and effective across a wide range of marine conditions. Additionally, the systemwilloperate in real-time, improving both safety and operational efficiency.

1.2. Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project is to develop a high-performance systemcapable of classifyingsonar signals into either rock or mine categories. This classification systemwill utilize advancedmachine learning techniques, specifically deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), to distinguish between rocks and mines based on sonar input. The project aims toreducefalse positive rates, improve detection accuracy, and minimize operational inefficienciesinunderwater detection systems. The secondary objective is to create a scalable solution that can adapt to different environments. Thisincludes training the system on a wide range of sonar data to ensure robust performanceacrossvarious underwater conditions. Finally, the project seeks to implement a real-time detectionsystemthat will provide immediate feedback, making it useful in military, shipping, and commercialoperations. By meeting these objectives, the project hopes to contribute to safer, moreefficientunderwater exploration and defense.
3.2 DataSet
The dataset has been collected from UCI Repository. It has come across 61 features whichdefineand differentiate Rocks and Mines and comprises of 209 samples. This data is used for trainingandtesting purpose. The Last column in this dataset indicates that, whether it's a mine or a rock, whichisuseful in prediction. The dataset is included in this repository.

3.3 Model
The model used here is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that initsbasicform uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses asigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values
including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoidfunc. removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1. As it a binary classificationmodelit is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.
